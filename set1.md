Certainly! Here is Set 1 of interview questions along with answers in bullet points, based on your skills and experience. Each question is unique, and I’ll avoid repeating them across other sets.

Set 1: Interview Questions and Answers

	1.	Can you explain the component-based architecture in Angular and its benefits?
	•	Angular organizes applications as components, each encapsulating HTML, CSS, and logic.
	•	Promotes modularity, reusability, and easier testing.
	•	Helps manage large applications by breaking them down into small, maintainable parts.
	2.	How do you handle state management in Angular applications?
	•	Use RxJS observables and services for local component communication.
	•	Leverage Angular’s @ngrx/store for centralized state management in complex apps.
	•	Manage state effectively to reduce redundant API calls and improve app performance.
	3.	What is Dependency Injection (DI) in .NET, and why is it important?
	•	DI is a design pattern in which dependencies are injected into objects rather than hard-coded.
	•	Reduces coupling and increases testability.
	•	Allows for flexibility, making it easy to swap dependencies (e.g., for testing).
	4.	Describe your approach to implementing RESTful APIs with ASP.NET Core Web API.
	•	Follow REST principles, using HTTP methods correctly (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
	•	Use routing and controllers to handle requests and return JSON responses.
	•	Handle exceptions with middleware, use attribute-based validation, and implement pagination.
	5.	How do you optimize SQL queries in SQL Server?
	•	Use indexing to speed up frequently queried columns.
	•	Avoid using SELECT * and retrieve only required columns.
	•	Leverage joins and subqueries smartly; avoid unnecessary nested loops.
	•	Analyze query execution plans to identify performance bottlenecks.
	6.	What is the role of Entity Framework Core in .NET, and when would you prefer Dapper?
	•	Entity Framework Core is an ORM that simplifies data access by mapping objects to database tables.
	•	Suitable for complex queries, object tracking, and high-level abstraction.
	•	Prefer Dapper when speed is essential and control over SQL is needed; it’s a lightweight ORM, fast for large datasets.
	7.	Explain the SOLID principles with examples from your experience.
	•	Single Responsibility: Each class/module should have one responsibility; e.g., a separate service class for data access.
	•	Open-Closed: Code should be open for extension, closed for modification, e.g., extending classes via inheritance.
	•	Liskov Substitution: Subtypes should be substitutable for their base types without altering behavior.
	•	Interface Segregation: Small, specific interfaces instead of large general ones; e.g., interfaces dedicated to logging or caching.
	•	Dependency Inversion: High-level modules shouldn’t depend on low-level modules; use interfaces.
	8.	How do you ensure data security when using Azure Active Directory B2C?
	•	Implement user authentication and authorization using OAuth2 and OpenID Connect.
	•	Encrypt sensitive data, both in transit and at rest.
	•	Regularly audit permissions and restrict access based on user roles.
	9.	Can you explain Microservices architecture and its pros and cons?
	•	Microservices divide an application into smaller, independent services that communicate over APIs.
	•	Pros: Scalability, maintainability, faster deployment, and resilience.
	•	Cons: Complexity in managing services, potential for increased network latency, and challenging to handle transactions.
	10.	What are some techniques to improve performance in Angular applications?
	•	Lazy loading modules to load only required resources.
	•	Use ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush to limit unnecessary change detection cycles.
	•	Optimize DOM manipulation using trackBy in ngFor.
	•	Minimize API calls, cache frequently used data, and use async pipes.
	11.	Describe how you handle error handling and logging in .NET applications.
	•	Use try-catch blocks and log critical errors with stack traces.
	•	Implement global exception handling middleware in ASP.NET Core.
	•	Log errors centrally using Azure Application Insights or other logging frameworks like Serilog.
	12.	What is Clean Architecture, and how do you apply it in your projects?
	•	Clean Architecture separates application concerns into layers (e.g., Presentation, Application, Domain, Infrastructure).
	•	Promotes testability and separation of concerns by decoupling business logic from infrastructure.
	•	Layers depend inward, allowing for flexible infrastructure components.
	13.	How do you approach testing in TDD, especially with CI/CD pipelines?
	•	Start by writing unit tests for each functionality, focusing on one feature at a time.
	•	Develop tests for edge cases, validations, and business logic.
	•	Use automated testing in CI/CD pipelines to ensure code quality and catch issues early.
	14.	Explain how CQRS is used and its advantages.
	•	CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) separates commands (write operations) from queries (read operations).
	•	Improves performance by optimizing read and write models separately.
	•	Increases scalability and aligns with domain-driven design for complex business logic.
	15.	How does RxJS enhance Angular applications? Provide examples.
	•	RxJS enables reactive programming with observables, ideal for handling asynchronous data streams.
	•	Common use: API calls (HTTPClient returns observables) and reactive forms.
	•	switchMap, mergeMap, debounceTime are often used to handle complex data flows efficiently.
	16.	What are some common challenges in using CI/CD pipelines with Azure DevOps, and how do you handle them?
	•	Managing secure credentials and environment-specific settings; use Azure Key Vault.
	•	Handling long build times; optimize pipeline steps by caching dependencies.
	•	Deploying to multiple environments; automate with YAML configuration.
	17.	Explain the differences between SOAP and REST APIs and when to use each.
	•	SOAP is a protocol with strict standards, supporting advanced security, suitable for enterprise and legacy systems.
	•	REST is more lightweight and uses HTTP; ideal for web applications needing flexibility and scalability.
	•	Choose SOAP for high security/transaction needs and REST for simpler, resource-based APIs.
	18.	How have you implemented Agile practices in your projects, and what benefits did you observe?
	•	Followed daily stand-ups, sprint planning, and retrospectives.
	•	Used Scrum to improve collaboration and task allocation.
	•	Benefits: Better communication, rapid adjustments, and more predictable delivery timelines.
	19.	What’s the purpose of using Crystal Reports, and what are its alternatives?
	•	Crystal Reports is used for generating complex reports from various data sources.
	•	Suitable for creating detailed, formatted, and professional-looking reports.
	•	Alternatives: SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS), Microsoft Power BI, and Telerik Reporting.
	20.	Describe a personal project you developed. What challenges did you face, and how did you overcome them?
	•	Built Ngp-Signature-Generator, facing challenges with secure digital signature algorithms.
	•	Researched cryptographic libraries for JavaScript, ensuring data integrity and security.
	•	Iteratively tested with different document formats to achieve compatibility.
