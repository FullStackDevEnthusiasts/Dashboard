Here’s Set 2 of interview questions with answers based on your skills and experience.

Set 2: Interview Questions and Answers

	1.	What is Angular’s lifecycle, and how do you use lifecycle hooks in your applications?
	•	Angular components have a series of lifecycle hooks (e.g., ngOnInit, ngOnChanges, ngOnDestroy).
	•	Use ngOnInit for initialization logic, ngOnChanges for input property changes, and ngOnDestroy for cleanup.
	•	Helps manage component state and resources, like unsubscribing from observables to prevent memory leaks.
	2.	How do you ensure code quality and readability in your Angular projects?
	•	Follow Angular style guide and enforce linting rules.
	•	Use meaningful naming conventions and organize code into modules and services.
	•	Write reusable components, services, and maintain modularity for scalability.
	3.	Describe the purpose and usage of HttpClient in Angular.
	•	HttpClient is Angular’s API for making HTTP requests, replacing the deprecated Http module.
	•	Supports features like interceptors, error handling, and request/response transformation.
	•	Allows integration with observables, enabling reactive programming.
	4.	How does ASP.NET Core’s middleware pipeline work, and why is it important?
	•	Middleware is a series of components handling HTTP requests and responses sequentially.
	•	Each middleware can perform actions like authentication, logging, and routing before passing to the next.
	•	Enables a modular and reusable approach to handling cross-cutting concerns.
	5.	What is a stored procedure, and when would you use one in SQL Server?
	•	A stored procedure is a precompiled set of SQL statements that can be executed as a single unit.
	•	Useful for complex data processing, repetitive tasks, and improving performance by reducing network traffic.
	•	Enhances security as permissions can be granted on stored procedures rather than on tables.
	6.	Explain how Dapper works in .NET applications and its advantages over Entity Framework.
	•	Dapper is a micro-ORM that maps C# objects to database tables, allowing custom SQL.
	•	Faster than Entity Framework due to its lightweight nature, with minimal abstraction.
	•	Ideal for performance-critical applications needing fine control over SQL queries.
	7.	How would you design a microservices architecture for a new project?
	•	Identify core functionalities and split them into distinct services (e.g., User Service, Order Service).
	•	Use APIs for communication, with asynchronous messaging for loosely coupled interactions.
	•	Implement centralized logging, monitoring, and an API gateway for managing requests.
	8.	What’s the difference between TypeScript and JavaScript, and why do you prefer TypeScript for Angular?
	•	TypeScript is a statically typed superset of JavaScript, providing features like classes, interfaces, and type safety.
	•	Enhances readability and maintainability by catching errors at compile time.
	•	TypeScript’s strong typing improves development efficiency in large-scale applications.
	9.	How do you handle caching in Angular applications?
	•	Use HttpClient’s CacheInterceptor to cache HTTP requests and reduce server load.
	•	Implement local storage or session storage for caching data locally.
	•	Control cache expiration and refresh policies to maintain data consistency.
	10.	What are the main principles of Domain-Driven Design (DDD), and how have you applied them?
	•	Focuses on aligning software with business domains and terms.
	•	Key concepts: entities, value objects, aggregates, repositories, and services.
	•	Applied DDD in complex domains where business rules dictate application behavior, ensuring software matches business needs.
	11.	Explain the Azure App Service and its key benefits.
	•	Azure App Service is a platform for hosting web applications, REST APIs, and mobile backends.
	•	Offers automatic scaling, high availability, and integration with CI/CD.
	•	Supports multiple programming languages and provides built-in monitoring and security.
	12.	What are some of the challenges you faced while using SSRS, and how did you solve them?
	•	Faced challenges with complex report layouts and slow-loading reports.
	•	Used caching and data-driven subscriptions to optimize report load times.
	•	Simplified report complexity by dividing reports into subreports and optimizing data sources.
	13.	How do you ensure scalability and performance in CI/CD pipelines on Azure DevOps?
	•	Optimize build and release steps by using parallel jobs and caching dependencies.
	•	Use YAML-based pipelines for flexibility, allowing easier maintenance and version control.
	•	Regularly monitor and analyze pipeline performance, adjusting tasks as needed to improve efficiency.
	14.	What’s the difference between eager loading and lazy loading in Entity Framework, and when would you use each?
	•	Eager loading retrieves related data with the main query, reducing database round trips.
	•	Lazy loading delays the retrieval of related data until explicitly accessed, reducing memory usage initially.
	•	Use eager loading when data is needed immediately; lazy loading when data is accessed conditionally.
	15.	How does Azure Active Directory B2C improve authentication in applications?
	•	Azure AD B2C allows easy integration of identity management, supporting various login methods (social accounts, emails).
	•	Ensures secure user authentication with features like multifactor authentication (MFA) and user consent.
	•	Offers customizable user flows, enhancing user experience and security.
	16.	Explain the async and await keywords in C# and when to use them.
	•	async enables asynchronous methods, while await pauses execution until a task completes.
	•	Helps prevent blocking of the main thread, improving application responsiveness.
	•	Useful for I/O-bound tasks like file reading or HTTP calls without freezing the UI.
	17.	How does ngIf differ from *ngFor in Angular?
	•	ngIf conditionally displays an element based on a true/false expression.
	•	*ngFor iterates over a list of items and generates an element for each item.
	•	Both are structural directives, but ngIf is for conditional rendering, while *ngFor is for iterating lists.
	18.	What are DTOs (Data Transfer Objects), and why are they useful in a microservices architecture?
	•	DTOs are simple objects used to transfer data between layers or services without exposing internal models.
	•	Reduce data transfer overhead by including only necessary fields.
	•	Ensure separation of concerns and provide a security layer by not exposing domain entities.
	19.	How do you handle concurrent database access in SQL Server?
	•	Use locking mechanisms like row locks or transaction isolation levels to manage concurrency.
	•	Apply optimistic concurrency using timestamps or versioning for high-read scenarios.
	•	Consider using NOLOCK hints carefully for read-only queries to avoid blocking but monitor for dirty reads.
	20.	Describe a challenging project requirement you faced in your personal projects and how you resolved it.
	•	Challenge: Implementing real-time validation in the Ngp-Rich-Text-Editor project for better user experience.
	•	Resolved by using debounced observables in Angular and WebSocket to update changes instantly.
	•	Improved performance by minimizing unnecessary API calls and using local state management.
